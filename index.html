      <h3 class="bg-cyan-500 italic">Dual-Credit Classes</h3>
      <p>
        While attending Steeleville High School I took several SWIC classes
        through the dual-credit program. Essentially, I gained both high school
        and college credits while taking the classes, which were typically at a
        higher level than their high school counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favorite dual-credit classes was Information Processing, one
        of the only computer classes we had in our small town school. There, we
        learned the basics of several programs in Microsoft Office including
        Word, Excel, Access, and Powerpoint. While not part of the SWIC class,
        we also had a web development club until COVID hit in 2020. We didn't
        get very far, but I created my first webpages in that club.
      </p>

      <h3 class="bg-cyan-500 italic">College Student</h3>
      <p>
        After graduating in 2022, I began my first proper semester at SWIC in
        the fall. My first three semesters alternated between computer classes
        and generals, but now I am mainly settling in computer classes in
        pursuit of an Associate's Degree in Applied Science, specializing in
        Computer Information Systems.

      <p>
        I have worked at the Walmart Supercenter in Sparta, IL, for two and a
        half years. I started in the clothing section, where I worked for a year
        before transferring to Electronics where I have been ever since. Some of
        my more important tasks in Electronics include daily audits of our
        inventory, selling electronic products to customers, and troubleshooting
        basic problems that our customers have (although we're not exactly
        qualified to solve most of them). I plan on leaving Walmart in summer of
        this year to pursue an internship as part of SWIC's CIS-297 class.

      <p>
        I am an avid fan of the Dallas Cowboys, an American football team in the
        National Football League. While I haven't gotten to see the team win the
        Super Bowl, they have been fairly competitive for several years now and
        it's fun to see them rack up wins before the inevitable postseason
        disappointment.

      <p>
        I developed an interest in my family history at a young age after
        listening to some of my grandparents' stories. I built my first family
        tree in 2015, but began doing my own research in the summer of 2018.
        After greatly expanding my family tree in my first two years of
        research, I began putting more effort into verifying my connections and
        gathering sources. These days, I spend most of my genealogy time
        connecting sources to profiles and adding links to project trees.

    <h2>SWIC Student</h2>
    <h3>Dual-Credit Classes</h3>
    <p>While attending Steeleville High School I took several SWIC classes through the dual-credit program. Essentially, I gained both high school 
      and college credits while taking the classes, which were typically at a higher level than their high school counterparts.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite dual-credit classes was Information Processing, one of the only computer classes we had in our small town school.
        There, we learned the basics of several programs in Microsoft Office including Word, Excel, Access, and Powerpoint. While not part of the SWIC class,
        we also had a web development club until COVID hit in 2020. We didn't get very far, but I created my first webpages in that club.</p>
      
    <h3>College Student</h3>
    <p>After graduating in 2022, I began my first proper semester at SWIC in the fall. My first three semesters alternated between computer classes 
      and generals, but now I am mainly settling in computer classes in pursuit of an Associate's Degree in Applied Science, specializing in 
      Computer Information Systems.

    <h2>Walmart Associate</h2>
    <p>I have worked at the Walmart Supercenter in Sparta, IL, for two and a half years. I started in the clothing section, where I worked 
      for a year before transferring to Electronics where I have been ever since. Some of my more important tasks in Electronics include daily
      audits of our inventory, selling electronic products to customers, and troubleshooting basic problems that our customers have (although
      we're not exactly qualified to solve most of them). I plan on leaving Walmart in summer of this year to pursue an internship as part of
      SWIC's CIS-297 class.</p>

    <h2>Dallas Cowboys Fan</h2>
    <p>I am an avid fan of the Dallas Cowboys, an American football team in the National Football League. While I haven't gotten to see the team win the Super Bowl,
      they have been fairly competitive for several years now and it's fun to see them rack up wins before the inevitable postseason disappointment.</p></div>

    <h2><img src="images/genealogy.png" height="360px" width="400px" alt="Family Tree"></h2>
    <h2>Genealogist</h2>
    <p>I developed an interest in my family history at a young age after listening to some of my grandparents' stories. I built my first family tree in 
      2015, but began doing my own research in the summer of 2018. After greatly expanding my family tree in my first two years of research, I began 
      putting more effort into verifying my connections and gathering sources. These days, I spend most of my genealogy time connecting sources to 
      profiles and adding links to project trees.</p>
